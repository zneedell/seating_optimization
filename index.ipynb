# # Running Code

# First and foremost, the Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running code. The notebook is capable of running code in a wide range of languages. However, each notebook is associated with a single kernel.  This notebook is associated with the IPython kernel, therefor runs Python code.

# ## Code cells allow you to enter and run code

# Run a code cell using `Shift-Enter` or pressing the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class="icon-step-forward fa fa-step-forward"></i></button> button in the toolbar above:

# In[2]:


a = 10


# In[3]:


print(a)


# There are two other keyboard shortcuts for running code:
# 
# * `Alt-Enter` runs the current cell and inserts a new one below.
# * `Ctrl-Enter` run the current cell and enters command mode.

# ## Managing the Kernel

# Code is run in a separate process called the Kernel.  The Kernel can be interrupted or restarted.  Try running the following cell and then hit the <button class='btn btn-default btn-xs'><i class='icon-stop fa fa-stop'></i></button> button in the toolbar above.

# In[4]:


import time
time.sleep(10)


# If the Kernel dies you will be prompted to restart it. Here we call the low-level system libc.time routine with the wrong argument via
# ctypes to segfault the Python interpreter:
